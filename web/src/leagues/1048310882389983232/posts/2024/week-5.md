Some incredibly close matchups this week were decided by Monday night and they resulted in some
pretty big shifts in the standings. For the first time since sometime last year (idk when, Joe can
look it up), someone other than Julian is in first place! We also got some trades to review, a new
team name, and an exciting update to everyone‚Äôs favorite new section! And shoutout to Danny for
running for 43 miles, winning the stupid race, and not getting rabdo (if you don‚Äôt know what it is
don‚Äôt look it up)!

## ü•£ Tudbert Bowl

Tolbert was the hero Sunday night and had a career game in the first game with Cooks on IR. Sprained

- **Herbert**: 1
- **Tolbert**: 2

## ü§ù Trade Review

### Julian receives:

- Jordan Mason

### Max receives:

- Romeo Doubs
- Julian‚Äôs 2027 3rd

Let‚Äôs start with Julian‚Äôs side. Did he need Jordan Mason? Nah. He‚Äôs already got Saquon, Kenneth
Walker, James Cook, and Brian Robinson. And by the time playoffs come around, CMC should be back and
Mason should be irrelevant. So Julian is basically paying to raise his % chance of the bye juuuust a
little bit. From that perspective, I‚Äôm not sure it was an advisable move. But on the other hand, he
was _never_ going to start Romeo Doubs and also always be optimizing. I think this is _fine_ but I
do wonder if Julian could‚Äôve spent his capital on a more of a future facing move than this one
(unless this is a precursor to something else).

For Max, yeah sure I guess this is fine (despite Romeo Doubs being an absolute brat and getting
benched shortly after this trade was made). I mean he was clearly going to trade Mason, so from that
perspective this makes sense. And I think this is totally solid value! I guess I just don‚Äôt think a
whole lot about Doubs as a player so for me this feels like a slightly underwhelming return.

So I‚Äôm allllmost tempted to call this a lose lose but instead I‚Äôll just say it‚Äôs fine. Not great,
not bad, just fine.

### Tucker receives:

- JK Dobbins

### Nick receives:

- Tucker‚Äôs 2026 2nd
- Tucker‚Äôs 2025 3rd

**(Written by Joe)**

Another week, another trade recap where Tucker acquires a new RB. Tuck keeps on winning and is doing
is best to take relatively cheap swings with upside at the RB position, compared to the stable of
absolute donkeypoop he has currently rostered. I think this is a somewhat fair price, but might be a
little on the steep side given Dobbins‚Äô injury history and recent performance. That being said, I
wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see him bounce back moving forward, and he has massive upside for Tucker,
which simply isn‚Äôt true about his team, and it is still not all that much to give up. For Nick, I‚Äôm
a huge fan, because it just seems safe for him to not really bet on having a huge shot at the title
this year, and continues to pick up some draft capital along the way to aid in his ability to add
talent in the offseason.

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

0.7 points was the difference between a 2-0 week and an 0-2 week for Julian. Kamara got one more
pass Monday night though and it sent Julian tumbling down to 3rd place in the standings. He‚Äôs still
ranked first though because he‚Äôs clearly got the best roster. It‚Äôs not particularly close either. If
we‚Äôre looking for areas of improvement, Julian really needs to improve his start/sit decisions. If I
were him I would simply start the players who are going to score the most points. If he‚Äôs able to do
that, he‚Äôll probably win. But that‚Äôs a big if! Enjoy your vacation buddy.

### Tier 2

#### 2. Steezy Nix (last week: 2)

In a season in which he lost CMC and Tua, Plank is sitting in first place. Not too shabby! The
winner of the 0.7 matchup is 8-2, propelled by continued greatness from veterans like Mike Evans and
Alvin Kamara. There‚Äôs some smoke about Russ taking over for Fields, but Bo Nix is winning games and
producing in fantasy and Tua may be back before too long, so Alex is probably fine at QB. Jake
Ferguson is like the only consistently producing TE right now and it kinda feels like Chuba Hubbard
will be productive right up until the time CMC returns and he can be subbed out of this lineup. It‚Äôs
been a tough road but this team is in a great spot right now.

#### 3. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 5)

Oh baby we‚Äôre really doing this huh? This is definitely a risky ranking, especially because Mixon
and Nabers could totally end up missing this week, but with Dobbins now in the fold to complement
Mixon, I finally have an actual RB room. It also seems like the Drake London breakout is happening
and Jayden Reed has exceeded even my very high expectations. When Puka gets healthy, it could be a
tough decision each week to decide which WR to bench (and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve forgotten about you, Mr
Shaheed and Mr Tolbert). These are good problems to have and they usually sort themselves out. Let‚Äôs
hope Spencer Rattler starts while Carr is out and throws nothing but reckless deep shots.

#### 4. Kastration Station (last week: 3)

This was always gonna be a tough week for Chuck with Gibbs, Montgomery, and Goedert (the other good
TE this year) on bye, but Charlie pulled out a win. 32% of his points came from a record-breaking
performance from Kirk Cousins, and boy that‚Äôs gotta be a great feeling for Charlie who has fought QB
demons for years now. Danny Dimes had a good game too! Tank Dell is a big wild card here - if he can
start producing like last year with Nico out, Charlie could start rolling.

### Tier 3

#### 5. Absolute Unitas (last week: 7)

The Rashee Rice injury sucks for Connor but his boys still look great. Chase Brown and Rico Dowdle
are scoring more and more points and could both be taking over their backfields (which is great
because I have them both in our eggs league) especially with Moss banged up. Brian Thomas is the big
story though, the dude looks _legit_. If Waddle can return to form whenever Tua comes back, Connor‚Äôs
got a really really good starting lineup. The lack of depth is still concerning though, and that‚Äôs
the main thing preventing me from moving Connor up into the tier above right now.

#### 6. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 6)

Deshuan Watson looks like the worst starting QB in football right now but Cam doesn‚Äôt seem to have
much choice other than to keep trotting him out there. I‚Äôm sure he would appreciate the Browns
replacing him with Jameis, who is ready to go on the bench of Cleveland and of the Clams. Cam got
some great streamer performances from Trey Sermon and Jordan Whittington to get a win this week and
keep him at .500. Diggs and Kelce should continue to get more targets while their teammates are
injured and Jakobi Meyers could produce even more if Davante gets moved. The Clams QB situation is
pretty scary but everything else is looking good I‚Äôd say!

### Tier 4

#### 7. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 4)

It‚Äôs been quite the tumble for Brian, who peaked at a #2 ranking but has fallen down to 7. At 3-7,
he‚Äôs in a hole to start the season and his team is trending in the wrong direction. Tyreek and
Breece are simply not producing in their offensive schemes right now. Derek Carr could miss a few
weeks. Aaron Jones could be hurt (though he has a bye anyways). There‚Äôs still a lot of talent here
so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see this team turn it around, but something needs to happen soon
otherwise Brian might fall further outside of the playoff picture.

#### 8. Great British Baker Show (last week: 10)

I may regret this ranking as Nick seems to be positioning himself as a seller, but even after
trading Dobbins he‚Äôs got a pretty full roster. This is what he did last year right? Trade the vets
but end up making a championship run anyways. What a way to play. Definitely some concerning stuff
on this team: ETN is hurt and getting out-touched by Bigsby (though Nick has him too), Nico is hurt,
and George Pickens is getting the Arthur Smith treatment. On the good side, Tyrone Tracy - who I
tried to trade for _before_ this happened - broke out this week, giving Nick a nice stable of young
RBs. Also Baker is the #3 player on the season, so epic.

#### 9. The Lamarmy (last week: 9)

Danny pointed out today that if he hadn‚Äôt benched Mark Andrews he would‚Äôve won this week. That‚Äôs
probably a good indicator this is just not his year. An absolutely brutal Monday night game in which
Olave only scored 2 points ended with Danny losing to Joe by 0.6 points. Literally just one more
Olave catch would‚Äôve done it. Feels like this happens every week to the Lamary, who now sit at 2-8.
The good news is that Lamar and Ja‚ÄôMarr are epic, Swift had a second consecutive good game, and I
had a dream that Calvin Ridley was the top scoring WR the rest of this season. Chin up Dan man!
Things definitely aren‚Äôt good right now but there‚Äôs enough good players that I‚Äôm keeping Danny
ranked 9th above‚Ä¶.

#### 10. Team benstone099 (last week: 8)

Ben is not in an enviable position right now. He‚Äôs got an aging roster, hurt players, a 4-6 record,
and doesn‚Äôt have his first round pick (though that doesn‚Äôt factor into these rankings). Devon Achane
is concussed and that could be a huge blow. Seems like Rodgers is okay though, so that‚Äôs something.
Would it be surprising to see Patrick Mahomes, Derrick Henry, and Trey McBride carry Ben back into
the playoff picture? Not at all! But right now we‚Äôve got a lot of downward trending arrows that I
even think Danny‚Äôs 2-8 boys have a better shot at the playoffs.

### Tier 5

#### 11. The Danny Pretzeler ü•® (last week: 12.5)

Okay back to some 2-8 boys who do _not_ have a shot at the playoffs. I guess I‚Äôm gonna keep flipping
them. It‚Äôs Joe‚Äôs turn to be in 11th because Joe Flacco is epic and Joe went 2-0 this week. Wicks
only getting 3 points was a massive disappointment but maybe that‚Äôs just the price you pay as a
fantasy owner to get production out of Kyle Pitts. Funny thing I learned today: Wandale Robinson has
the 3rd most targets in the NFL and only the 3rd most yards on the Giants. Insane. Time to see what
Drake Maye‚Äôs got (though wtf are the Patriots doing..)

#### 12. McConkey‚Äôs Bonked Up Boys (last week: 11)

Okay now that Jordan Mason is gone the Bonked Up Boys don‚Äôt look quite as real as they did (aside
from Darius Slayton okayyy we see you). Andy Dalton didn‚Äôt have it this week but Caleb Williams
continues to look better and better! Also love to see ‚ÄúOld Man Lockett‚Äù continue to put up points.
But yeah that‚Äôs about it here, this roster is a desert.
