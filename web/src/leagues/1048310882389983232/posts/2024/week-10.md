First new post in 'mmish! Very exciting times. I wrote about the new site below, but wanted to
reserve this intro section for footie. Last week was... weird. Danny notched the all-time highest
score but nobody else even got to 120 points and only 4 teams made it over 100. This led to some
shifting around in the standings and, naturally, in the rankings. Will Danny finally ascend to the
top of my rankings? Will I continue to keep him below my team without really explaining if I'm doing
it because I believe it or just cause I think it's funny? Read on to find out!

Also I'm cheating with that image a bit. I generated that one back in the offseason while making a
new team image for Danny's Lamarmy and have been waiting for a good chance to use it. I suppose I
should've used a more Tiger heavy image with the week that Ja'Marr just had, but hey Lamar was
seriously impressive too so I'm gonna roll with it. Also peep the falcons flying in sky.

## ‚ú® New features

Welcome to 'mmish! Ever since I first created this site and had to name the folder all the code was
in, I've wanted to come up with some sort of catchy name or brand. "Fantasy dashboard" just wasn't
doing it for me. On Monday I had a shower epiphany to call it _'mmish_, which is short for
"Commissioner" and makes me chuckle whenever I see someone use it. While this isn't strictly
speaking a tool for commissioners only, it is certainly a useful tool for commissioners and helps
achieve some of their function in the league.

With the name in place, I set about creating a logo and brand. I would like to state for the record
that the first thing I did was ask Eliza if I could pay her to design a logo. She declined, so I
went the AI route (a decision which I wouldn't recommend for anyone dating a designer). I hope to
one day replace the existing logo with one designed by a human, but I was eager to start building a
brand so it'll do for now.

I hope you like the logo! Personally I love his little suit - it really gives corrupt commissioner
doesn't it? Like you could absolutely pay that guy for a reduced suspension or a primetime tv slot.
He just loves money so much!!

Adding the branding definitely makes this thing suddenly feel very real. Who knows where (if
anywhere) it'll go, but it sure has been a fun hobby project so far. My hope is to get it to a point
where it's easy to introduce to other leagues, so if you participate in leagues that you think could
use something like this, definitely feel free to share! At the very least, it's a nice new look to a
fun hobby project.

## ü§ù Trade Review

### Tucker receives:

- Joe Flacco

### Ben receives:

- Tucker's 2024 4th
- Mason Rudolph

_Written by Charlie_

This is just nasty behavior by both Joe and Tucker here.

Tucker gets some pure QB depth from an actual back-up in Flacco with a limited window of opportunity
due to both age and not being the franchise quarterback. Flacco and Stroud share a bye-week, though,
so he will end up not being able to slot him in then, anyways. I suppose Tucker gets a QB who is
currently playing for a QB who just got benched and a 4th round pick? I feel like he would be better
off just playing one of his extra receivers at superflex instead of Bryce or Flacco if he does need
a sub for Stroud or Burrow. Not a lot of value here, but also not much lost. I can‚Äôt help but wonder
if the trade bug bit Tucker too hard and he cannot stop himself, even if the trade is mildly
meaningless.

For Joe, I mean, this is par for the course. Trade some absolute useless piece for a piece he
literally cannot use and a 4th round pick to be used on someone who will inevitably become a useless
piece he cannot use, just like 90% of his current roster. If you haven‚Äôt in a while and you have a
moment, go take a look at Joe‚Äôs team and tell me honestly that it isn‚Äôt the weirdest motley crew of
cast-offs and unprovens and no-names you‚Äôve ever seen. What‚Äôs more, the majority of the draft
capital that he has accrued is for 2027. Joe is playing the long game, for sure, but I wonder if he
is just looking far beyond the actual horizon of fielding a team, and all the way into space. Too
much time around telescopes.

I declare that they both lose -1k aura points for this trade. L Rizz.

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Kastration Station (last week: 2)

Welcome to the top, Charles. As longtime readers should know by now, I love putting too much stock
in head to head matchups. Despite mudded performances on both sides, Charlie beat out Julian this
week and takes the number one spot in the rankings. Do I think Charlie has the best roster in the
league? No, probably not. But we're 10 weeks in and he's 17-3 with a 3 game lead on Julian (though
his PF is lower so he'd need to maintain a gap) and remaining games against Joe and Max. I think the
odds of him getting a bye are clearly higher than anyone else and with how good some of these other
top teams are looking, being able to sit out the first round bloodbath could loom large.

#### 2. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

Julian falls down to number 2 and I came very close to dropping him to 3. With Dak now out for the
season, Julian has lost one his best QBs and, for one game at least, is suffering through reduced
CeeDee production. Losing to Charlie is by one point is a tough pill to swallow, though having lost
in a similar way to Julian I'd say it evens out. Relatively poor performances from Darnold, Ceedee,
and Saquon this week were the main culprits though I don't really expect any of that to continue,
except for maybe in Ceedee's case. Honestly getting 107 points with those 3 underperforming and DK,
Walker, Bowers on bye and and Tee injured is pretty good! Julian's definitely stumbling a bit but
he's still got a great roster and a 2 game lead on the next 2 teams in these rankings.

#### 3. The Lamarmy (last week: 4)

A record-breaking week from the Lamary certainly had me thinking about moving them up higher, and I
think there is a very good case to be made that Danny has the single best starting lineup in the
league right now. He's also now first (albeit barely) in PF, which would be significant in a
tiebreaker scenario. Lamar, Jamarr, and Bijan are all absolutely balling right now, plus we're
seeing some good games from Ridley and Andrews. Olave going on IR defintely a big blow but we saw a
clear demonstration this week of how that might not actually matter too much. So why not put Danny
higher? Well certainly part of it is that it's fun not too, but the real reasons are:

1. 2-game deficit in the standings behind Julian
2. A tougher ROS schedule than Julian
3. Less depth than Julian

Alright surely that's more than enough words to avoid some outrage texts from him this week.

#### 4. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 3)

Not quite the week I envisioned after Thursday's epic Joe Burrow performance, but it was still
somehow good enough for 2nd most in the league. CJ Stroud's recent performance has been troubling,
as was watching Dalton Kincaid leave the game with a knee injury, and can we please get someone else
to play QB for the Giants? Good to see the WR depth popping off though with MHJ, Pearsall, and
Bateman all popping off on the bench. Time to build up some momentum and make a push back up the
standings.

### Tier 2

#### 5. Steezy Nix (last week: 7)

There's a pretty big gap between tier 1 and tier 2 right now; all of these next teams have some
pretty serious holes in their rosters. We'll start with Alex who got a much needed 2-0 week and
bumps his record up to 14-6. It was a welcome return for CMC who slipped right back into his old
role, but the big story of the week was Chuba Hubbard who not only got extended (what are the
Panthers doing) but had the game of his career in Germany. We'll see what happens if Brooks ever
starts playing but for now Chuba looks good. The hole for Alex is definitely WR and that probably
needs to improve if he wants to hang on to his playoff spot, but being 8 games over .500 is enough
of a lead where I feel more confident in him making the playoffs than anyone else in this tier.

#### 6. Absolute Unitas (last week: 5)

Next we'll go with Connor who got poor production this week from nearly everybody on this roster
(except 'mmish favorite Chase Brown, we love that guy). Regression alone will provide a big boost to
Connor, who at 12-8 has the best record in this tier. BTJ's dip in production is concerning with
Lawrence going down, but I love the upside of this roster, especially if the rookies on the bench
(Benson, Coleman, and Coker???) become useable.

#### 7. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 6)

The Clams were only team in this tier to score 100+ points this week and that sure is impressive
when you consider Cam started Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, Trey Palmer, and Jaleel McLaughlin. The tush
push is really something. Jakobi Meyers was on bye this week but Michael Pittman's injury is not one
that Cam can really afford with how thin he is at WR. The RBs, QBs, and Kelce are all nice but
Amon-Ra can only shoulder the WR load so much here.

#### 8. Team benstone099 (last week: 8)

It sucks for Ben and the Jets but it sure is satisfying to watch Aaron Rodgers struggle. We saw last
week that Ben does have a fairly high ceiling when his players play well, but we saw this week that
the floor is real low too. There is some intriguing production that was left on the bench, most
notably Jauan Jennings, but Ben is probably wishing that he could play Trey McBride at WR instead of
having to choose between him and Kittle at TE. Ben's in an interesting spot here: he doesn't have
his first, so there's not a whole lot of incentive for him to tank, but at 10-10, he also has the
worst record in this tier and it's hard for me to envision him getting past the teams ahead of him
to make the playoffs. It'll take some creative captaining to set a good course from here though.

### Tier 4

#### 9. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 10)

Does record matter when I get to this part of the rankings? Idk, who makes the rules around here
anyways? I'm moving Brian back up to the 9 spot because I think his team is pretty clearly better
than the teams below him, even though he is 4-16. It sure hasn't looked great for Xavier Worthy huh?
I was admittedly high on him coming into the season and that's looking like an L so far, especially
considering the guys drafted around him in our rookie draft. It was nice to see Tyreek able to play
and get a TD on Monday, plus Nuk looks like the guy in KC right now, ditto Bucky Irving in TB. This
team is definitely not nearly as bad as their record indicates, which could be counterproductive for
draft purposes.

#### 10. Kyler X(box)Y (last week: 9)

Nick squeaked out a win against Ben this week thanks entirely to Kyler, Tracy, and Pickens. Everyone
else pulled a Jermaine Burton and slept through the weekend. Cooper Rush scoring -2 fantasy points
is truly impressive. Javonte Williams was stuck in the backseat behind Estime, which is worrying for
Nick if it continues, but good to see Jaylen Warren and Tyjae Spears getting work as they come back
from injury. The guy Nick is really waiting on is Rome Odunze though and boy do things seem
miserable in Chicago right now. I'm going there to visit Charlie next week so will get a first-hand
look and report back!

### Tier 7

#### 11. The Danny Pretzeler ü•® (last week: 11)

Joe takes the lead in max pf, which I know he's very excited about, but he stays ranked 11th in here
despite scoring a truly putrid 51 points. I haven't gone back to see what my lowest point total was
during my tank era, but maybe that's something I can ask my quant (Joe) to figure out. Cool to see
AD Mitchell getting some action though, I know Joe's excited about that. Plus Drake Maye and the
Patriots beating Caleb and his "best landing spot" Bears is definitely great for the clubhouse.

#### 12. McConkey‚Äôs Bonked Up Boys (last week: 12)

I should probably stop stomping on the Bears as I head to Chicago, but cmon guys this sucks to
watch. They did just fire their OC so at the very least there's a scapegoat, but we'll have to wait
and see if we get some meaningful improvement. The Estime production bump is raising eyebrows and
boy is it nice to see Sam LaPorta scoring points again. It didn't end up mattering (nothing really
does when you only score 58 points), but if Andy Dalton isn't starting for the Panthers he
definitely shouldn't be starting in the superflex spot in fantasy.
