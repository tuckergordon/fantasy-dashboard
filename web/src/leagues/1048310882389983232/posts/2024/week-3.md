# Week 3 Recap

Yeahhhh we‚Äôre doing multiple images now. I have too many ideas and I realized that 1 image was a completely arbitrary and unnecessary limitation I was putting on myself. You‚Äôre probably wondering what the hell is the point of the cereal bowl boxing one. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll get to that...

Week 3 saw several close matchups and an extremely close median all decided by some MNF action that I of course slept through. The result is the start of some separation in the standings and yet another big shake up to the rankings.

## ü•£ Tudbert Bowl

What‚Äôs this? A new segment! Oh you better believe it. Joe believes that the nickname of ‚ÄúTudbert‚Äù belongs to Bears RB Khalil Herbert. I however believe that to be a misnomer given his utter lack of tudiness and believe the nickname should instead go to personal fav Jalen Tolbert.

How will we decide? Well by keeping tally of how many touchdowns each of them scores this season of course! So welcome to the TUDBERT BOWL, the newest, shortest, and most unwelcome addition to the weekly newsletter!

Herbert: 1
Tolbert: 1

That‚Äôs all for this week‚Äôs TUDBERT BOWL, thanks for tuning in!

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

I‚Äôm sooooo bored of this team scoring 130+ points each week. I don‚Äôt have anything to write about. No new content. Julian‚Äôs the best! Saquon‚Äôs great! CeeDee only scored 6.70 points and it literally didn‚Äôt matter. The Bonies are in cruise control on I-35 and nobody else is on the road.

### TIER 2:

#### 2. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 2)

Now that‚Äôs more like it now we got stuff to talk about. I, once again, wasn‚Äôt watching the second half of MNF so I missed the drama in Brian‚Äôs matchup against Danny, but seems like we had a bunch of it! I saw Josh Allen go God mode in the first half so I figured something like this could happen, but Brian barely squeaked out a victory over Danny. Unfortunately for Brian, he himself fell a point shy of the median and had to settle for a 1-1 week. Sure is better than 0-2 though (more on that in a bit). Brian‚Äôs got studs but he‚Äôs also got a sneaky large amount of depth. Hungry for RB depth myself I looked up who had Braelon Allen in our league: Brian. Okay fine, but what about Bucky Irving? Also Brian. Now Brian is looking a little less powerful in the starting lineup with Tyreek stuck with lord knows throwing to him and Njoku still out with a high ankle sprain, but he‚Äôs got the depth to last the season and plenty of capital to make moves if he feels like it (unlikely). Strong team.

#### 3. Kastration Station (last week: 6)

Welcome to tier two, Chuck! I‚Äôve been very up and down on Charlie‚Äôs team this season but it‚Äôs definitely pretty up right now! Victory in an epic high scoring matchup with Plank decided by a mere 2 points? Perhaps Charlie‚Äôs luck has turned. Kyren has picked up right where he left off, Gibbs and Montgomery continue to perform even in a split backfield, and Brock Purdy has proven that his success isn‚Äôt just due to throwing to stud WRs (no comment about the system though). The biggest news for Charlie this week was Terry McLaurin finally connecting with Jayden Daniels. Second biggest was Dallas Goedert having maybe the best game of his career; he should continue to get plenty of action with AJB and maybe DeVonta out for the Eagles. If Charlie can just get a little more out of Tank Dell and hold off until Kupp returns, he‚Äôs looking strong.

#### 4. Steezy Nix (last week: 10)

Okay I shouldn‚Äôt have ranked Alex 10th last week. The Tua and CMC injuries are obviously devastating, but Alex has weathered them well so far. Nix had by far his best week as a pro and seems to have enough rushing ability to have a decent floor even in a terrible offense. Justin Fields has also been solid and boy does it make me happy to see him actually winning NFL games. Similar to Charlie, the big change for Plank this week was an underperforming veteran receiver finally putting up a big game as Diontae Johnson looked fantastic with Andy Dalton throwing him passes (plus it led to a huge Chuba Hubbard game too). We‚Äôd love to see more out of Mike Evans but Chris Godwin being WR3 on the season has been awesome for this team. The result was a 135 point week that unfortunately was only 1-1, but still a good showing from the Steezy boys.

### TIER 3:

Alright this is where the mess starts. I have no idea how to rank these next 6 teams. If you disagree with this order, that‚Äôs totally fine. I‚Äôve been copying and pasting these teams in so many different orders. At a certain point I just had to put them in order and this is what I ended up with.

#### 5. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 7)

Me first why not. I‚Äôm 4-2 but boy juuuuust barely. Change a few points over the past two weeks and I‚Äôd be 1-5 instead. But those wins are in the bag and the arrows are definitely point up right now. Malik Nabers is already producing like a WR1 (quite literally actually) and Marvin Harrison Jr isn‚Äôt far behind him. Joe Burrow connected with Ja‚ÄôMarr and put together his first big week and Dalton Kincaid finally showed up. Should‚Äôve known Rashid Shaheed would score 0 the second I put him in my starting lineup but hey going 2-0 despite that is huge for morale (and Jayden Reed will probably be coming back into the starting lineup this week assuming Jordan Love is healthy). Obviously still don‚Äôt have much to show at the RB position but everything else is looking pretty dandy so far.

#### 6. Absolute Unitas (last week: 8)

Connor and I are playing each other this week which should be fun. Our teams are similarly constructed and on similar timelines. Connor stays ranked lower because of a few things: Richardson looking like a very unfinished product, Jaylen Waddle looking borderline unstartable without Tua, and a general lack of depth. That said, boy has Jayden Daniels looked good, same with Rashee Rice, and Jordan Love‚Äôs hopefully imminent return means Richardson could be benched if need be. Plus Dowdle and Brown are both starting to get more run in their respective backfields. Should be a fun battle this week Con.

#### 7. Team benstone099 (last week: 4)

Ben was on the losing end of close matchups and the median this week, meaning this is a tough 0-2 for him. I‚Äôd normally expect Ben to crush when he gets nearly 50 points from Henry and Cooper, but the rest of this team really underperformed this week, including the guys who have carried him so far: Achane and McBride. Hopefully Ben has at least one McBride and Kittle back this week. Gabe Davis did the thing where he busted instead of boomed while Jauan Jennings put up 40 points on the bench, but hey it happens. One huge positive this week for Ben was that Aaron Rodgers looked good if not great, and if that continues Ben‚Äôs roster will be strong.

#### 8. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 5)

Another close matchup loss here, but at least Cam gets the median. The QB situation is pretty concerning for the Clams right now, as Hurts doesn‚Äôt have anyone to throw to and Watson looks terrible out there. Luckily Cam has a healthy Jonathan Taylor putting up big points to go with Amon-Ra St. Brown, Steffon Diggs, and Zack Moss. If he can get a little more production out of Pittman and Kelce and if Watson can put up QB2 production, Cam should be fine.

#### 9. The Lamarmy (last week: 3)

Yeahhhh alright I can‚Äôt continue to rank this team as high as I have been. Danny has had the opposite luck as I have as he is a few points away from being 6-0 instead of 1-5. But again, those losses are on the board and Danny is 3rd worst in max pf in the league. Danny benched franchise QB Justin Herbert for Minshew this week and it was actually the right call. But Minshew may not even be starting soon and Herbert is clearly banged up, so there‚Äôs a chance that this gets real ugly real quick. Really nice to see Ja‚ÄôMarr and Olave have big games, but this Mark Andrews situation is getting more and more concerning every week, Calvin Ridley took a huge step back this week, and D‚ÄôAndre Swift looks bad. The good news is that Keenan Allen and Jordan Addison should be coming back soon, but Danny‚Äôs already in a pretty big hole and I‚Äôm struggling to see how he‚Äôs gonna climb out of it unless everyone gets healthy and Andrews suddenly regains form.

### TIER 4:

#### 10. Great British Baker Show (last week: 9)

Nick gets his own tier because I don‚Äôt really know what to do with this team and my hunch is that he doesn‚Äôt either. There are some great players here, especially Nico Collins (stud) and Rome Odunze (rookie stud). Baker and Kyler are QB5 and QB6 on the season too! But Likely hasn‚Äôt been come close to his week 1 performance and Pickens has been just okay. I have a hard time seeing this team making a playoff run like last year, but it‚Äôs certainly much more likely than the remaining two teams so I‚Äôm just gonna leave Nick right here for now.

### TIER 5:

#### 11. McConkey Tonk Honky Bonk (last week: 12)

I‚Äôve been dumping on Max for weeks now and leaving him for dead in the 12 spot. If anything I think his team is worse off now than it was a week ago - Caleb‚Äôs still struggling, DeVonta is concussed, and LaPorta might be hurt. But I simply cannot ignore him absolutely thrashing Joe last week, nearly doubling his score - a performance like that deserves a bump in ranking so welcome to the 11 spot Max and team (especially you Andy Dalton, you handsome devil).

#### 12. Wetzel Jetzel (last week: 11)

Yeah that‚Äôs right Joe I ranked you LAST. That‚Äôs what you get for your pathetic 57 point showing. The tank is on more than it ever has been - Joe somehow already has a 40 point lead in the draft lottery - though that‚Äôs not necessarily a good thing. TLaw and the Jags look like absolute garbage right now, which isn‚Äôt good if Joe‚Äôs counting on him long term. Shakir and JSN have been bright spots this year for sure and Zay Flowers just got gamescripted out of this week‚Äôs game, but that‚Äôs about it. This team is years away from contention and Joe really can‚Äôt afford any more misses (coughing in your direction, Mr. Pitts).
