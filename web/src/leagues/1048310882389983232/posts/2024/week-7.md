Some of you are also in our eggs league where this week Charlie wrote an exceptional (in both
quality and quantity) breakdown of the state of the league. It's so hard to follow something like
that up, but the content machine must keep churning so here we are.

I know it feels like we say this every week (and every season), but damn what a brutal stretch of
injuries it's been. This week saw some very high profile injuries and those came with some big
ramifications to my rankings.

## üí© Draft Lottery

I don't normally add commentary to this section but there's some crazy stuff here. Nick owns 2 of
the lottery spots right now and his pick isn't even one of them! Brian has the 4th best max PF in
the league but is in 10th in the standings.

|     | Name             | Max PF |
| --- | ---------------- | ------ |
| 1   | Joe              | 716.82 |
| 2   | Tucker (via Max) | 738.76 |
| 3   | Nick (via Cam)   | 864.10 |
| 4   | Nick (via Ben)   | 875.66 |
| 5   | Danny            | 912.26 |
| 6   | Brian            | 957.70 |

## ü•£ Tudbert Bowl

Tolbert was on bye this week and Herbert has been on bye since week 2. Nothing new here. Section
getting kinda boring..

- **Herbert**: 1
- **Tolbert**: 2

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

Haha okay okay sorry Julian you get your own tier again. 145.74 points from the big dog, and that
was even with a 0 from Deebo and his last minute scratch. Dak and CeeDee bye week? Who cares - the
Geno/DK/Ken Walker stack was just as good. Oh and here's Russ and Rachaad scoring 25 points on his
bench too. The Aiyuk injury obviously sucks but it also just doesn't really change anything for
Julian. Idk how he lost all those games the past few weeks but surely just a blip on the radar. The
Bonies are back.

### Tier 2

#### 2. Kastration Station (last week: 3)

A somewhat fortunate 2-0 week for Charlie who scored only 101.56 points, and honestly it's amazing
he even got that many with literally zero points from Tank Dell and Courtland Sutton, not to mention
poor showings from Kirk and Schultz. There was a brief injury scare with David Montgomery but he had
a good game nonetheless and Gibbs was sicko mode. Charlie has the best record in the league and the
boys are looking good. What could possibly go wrong?

#### 3. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 4)

I'm moving myself up to 3 but that has more to do with Alex falling (more on that in a bit) than me
rising. Patting myself on the back for trading for Drake London and Joe Mixon, otherwise I might've
lost to Joe this week. Maybe it's a bad sign that I look at my roster on a week when pretty much
everyone outside of Mixon and London had disappointing showings and think that there's nothing
wrong. But I trust my young receivers to get better as the season goes on and I think this week was
just a weird blip. Keeping myself ranked up here for now.

### Tier 3

#### 4. The Lamarmy (last week: 7)

Alright I've seen enough, Danny gets to come back up. Replace Pacheco with Kareem Hunt and this is
finally looking more like the kind of performance Danny expected at the start of the year. Danny has
the QB1 and the WR1 and they're both balling right now (especially Lamar). Bijan is only RB6 but
he's seemingly been unleashed the past 2 games and it's been a ton of fun to watch. The X factor for
Danny was always going to be Mark Andrews though and Danny's revival has coincided with Mark's.
Danny doesn't get to move up a tier quite yet - gonna need to get above .500 first and also is that
Noah Brown in the starting lineup? But he's well on his way.

#### 5. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 6)

What a mixed first game with Baker for the Clams eh? 29 points is exactly the kind of performance
Cam was hoping for when he traded for Baker, but it may be bittersweet with the injuries to Evans
and Godwin. Can Baker remain a QB1 or even a QB2 without those two? We'll have to see. Really
awesome to see Chubb back on the field and scoring a TD. Hopefully he can build on his performance
and become a contributor to Cam's lineup. If Cam could get a productive and healthy Chubb and
Taylor, his team could be a real force down the stretch. I guess I should mention the Deshaun Watson
injury here as well, but in an effed up way it may actually be a good thing for the Clams if Jameis
ends up starting.

#### 6. Absolute Unitas (last week: 5)

It took quite the wave of Monday night fortune but Connor squeaked out a win over a devastated Alex
(I said we'll get to him just give me a sec okay) to avoid an 0-1 night. At this point Connor's
success is very directly tied to the health of his QBs. With Jayden Daniels (who is soooo tiny like
sooooooo tiny and frail and could be snapped in half by a lineman at any moment) being described as
"week-to-week" and Anthony Richardson having caught a nasty case of the Badatpassingdapigkins,
things don't look especially good at the moment for Connor. He needs big performances from his QBs
and WRs to outweigh his light RB room, so with question marks popping up at QB he's going to spend
some time down in the rankings a bit.

#### 7. Steezy Nix (last week: 2)

Shit man, I feel so bad for Alex. The dude has really been trying with this roster, making moves
over the past year or two to take advantage of veterans like CMC, Kamara, and Evans and get a
championship before they start to decline. On Monday night, he got hit with an absolute avalanche of
shit. Chris Godwin is out for the season. Mike Evans seems to be out until at least week 11. As if
losing those two weren't bad enough, those injuries cost him the win against Connor. Plus all of
this happened in a week where Justin Fields seemingly lost the starting job to Wilson.

At this point I think the question really becomes where does Alex go from here? There is some good
news: he's still got a nice cushion at 10-4 and Tua sounds like he could be back soon, maybe even
this week. But Alex's WR room right now is Diontae Johnson (just scored 2.20 points), Darnell Mooney
(eh not bad actually), andddd that's about it. Losing his two best WRs in a matter of minutes is
just such a big blow. Maybe he could trade for 1 or 2 WRs and tread water until Evans and CMC
return, but it's a risky gamble with a hole this big and I can't imagine he would feel too
comfortable trading his picks right now with the holes on his roster and his window rapidly closing.
Alex is in a tough spot for sure.

### Tier 4

#### 8. Team benstone099 (last week: 8)

**Derrick** Henry is such a beast. The RB1 on the year really put Ben's team on his back Monday
night and got them across the median. It was also nice to see Amari Cooper immediately find success
on his new team, but the same cannot be said for Davante Adams and the Jets. Ben's team has been one
of the most consistent from a rankings perspective - he's just sitting on the outside of the playoff
bubble looking in and I've yet to see anything meaningful enough to push him one direction or
another. 8th might just be the spot for him idk.

#### 9. Kyler X(box)Y (last week: 10)

Nick's team is such a joy. He trades away Baker and Dobbins and still manages to find himself in a
playoff spot. Pickens was balling with Russell Wilson, Tank Bigsby had a huge day without ETN,
Javonte Williams put up big numbers, and Kyler had a nice long run (but still missed a wide open
Marvin downfield cmonnnn Kyler need more from you buddy). Nick started Tre Tucker at superflex (not
saying it was the wrong call) and still went 2-0. So epic.

#### 10. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 9)

Brian what are we doing my guy? I get that there was a little uncertainty over Aaron Jones's health
last week but it was pretty clear that they thought he was healthy going into Sunday and yet here he
is on your bench while Michael Wilson gets 1 reception in the flex spot. At the end of the day,
managerial decisions can only do so much when Tyreek is getting literally 2 targets but the
Jones/Wilson decision literally would've meant a 2-0 week instead of a 0-2 one, and that's a big
reason why Brian is 4-10 with a 200 point difference between max PF and PF.

### Tier 5

#### 11. The Danny Pretzeler ü•® (last week: 12)

Sure let's switch these two again why not. Joe lost to me this week (thank god) and the tank is
going as planned. I know he's gotta be psyched to see Drake Maye putting up back-to-back 20 point
performances to start his career, that's huge for the squad. Also we are officially watching Kyle
Pitts and Kendre Miller for what appear to be signs of life! Very exciting stuff. Too bad Jameson
Williams is a dirty dirty cheater, that's not huge for the squad!

#### 12. McConkey‚Äôs Bonked Up Boys (last week: 11)

When Caleb is on bye, Dalton has a bad game, and AOC gets hurt, things are _bleak_. Max barely got
to the 50 point mark this week, though it's nice to see back-to-back good showings from the
recently-acquired Romeo Doubs. I think Devonta got gamescripted out but 0.30 points is tough to look
at. Sam LaPorta we miss you brother. Maybe you'll get some more passes with Jamo suspended? I sure
hope so...
