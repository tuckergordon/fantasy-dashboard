Been a busy week! I‚Äôve been wondering how I ever felt like I had time for writing these things and honestly was considering just not doing it this week or kinda phoning it in (which still might happen, I‚Äôm just starting out writing this thing). But the gods decided to punish me for even considering that annnddd I tested positive for Covid this morning. So I guess we might as well do this thing!

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (preseason: 1)

The Bonies were already üÜô, and now they have Saquon on the Eagles who looked unstoppable in week 1. This roster is extremely talented and they played up to their potential in week 1, leading the league with 150.50 points. Sheesh

### Tier 2

#### Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (preseason: 3)

Okay but hang on a second, Brian‚Äôs team also scored 150 (.36)! Xavier Worthy looked good in week 1 and scored 19.80 - if that keeps up, Brian‚Äôs team looks very strong. We were unsure what Tony Pollard‚Äôs role would look like but he came out strong, receiving the majority of the touches for the Titans. Tyreek avoided arrest from some shitbag cops and went on to do his usual 20+ point thing. Brian will be without David Njoku, at least for this week, but it seems like Tucker Kraft could be a decent fill in. Things good in Brian land.

### Tier 3

#### 3. The Lamarmy (preseason: 2)

Oof, pretty disastrous week 1 for Danny (in fantasy, pretty big week for him IRL) who finds himself in the basement. Some of the bad news can probably be chalked up to week 1 weirdness, like Chris Olave‚Äôs usage or the Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase situation. But Jordan Addison and Keenan Allen are hurt and boy there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of depth here to begin with. I‚Äôm leaving Danny in the 3 spot because I think the talent here is still extremely strong and he probably can weather another week or so of this, but he drops down a tier and is hoping for some good health news this week.

#### 4. Kastration Station (preseason: 4)

A bad QB week for Charlie as Kirk looked _bad_, Purdy only scored 10 points, and we don‚Äôt talk about Daniel Jones. But on the other hand, wow did Cooper Kupp look great and now he‚Äôs pretty much alone in that WR room. The Corum taking touches from Kyren storyline ended up not being real and Joe Mixon put up 25 points. A strong first week for the non-QB Kastrated fellas!

#### 5. Steezy Nix (preseason: 5)

Losing the redraft 1.01 to injury is always brutal, but especially so when it comes late Monday night. Alex went 2-0 regardless though, and it sounds like there‚Äôs still a chance CMC could return this week. Plus he‚Äôs playing Joe so he‚Äôs gonna go at least 1-1. Mike Evans is ageless, Chris Godwin thrived in his return to the slot, and the non-CMC runners all scored well. A very good week 1 for Plank, all things considered.

#### 6. Team Crams_Clams (preseason: 6)

I was with Cam this past weekend and we were one Jalen Hurts rushing TD away from winning a $500 parlay. We‚Äôll have to see if the existence of Saquon and the lack of Jason Kelce leads to fewer rushing TDs for Hurts (how could it not?), but still a solid week for the clams aside from the lack of Amon-Ra and Kelce. Deshaun Watson though looked bad and Cam doesn‚Äôt have any other options at QB, so this is a bit of a house of cards roster right now.

### TIER 4:

#### 7. Absolute Unitas (preseason: 7)

Too bad Jayden Daniels sucks and Connor was forced to draft him. Even with Jordan Love getting injured, Connor is looking great at QB with Richardson doing things no human should be able to do and Daniels manages to run and not get snapped in half. JJeff, Waddle, Rice did there things and BTJ looked fantastic in his debut. Now if he can just find a RB‚Ä¶

#### 8. Team benstone099 (preseason: 8)

BA mixed first week for Ben, who goes 1-1 after some strong performances (Rhamondre, Achane) but more not so strong ones. The good news is there‚Äôs a lot of positive regression likely here, as Henry, Adams, Cooper, Kirk, and McBride should all comfortably score. Idk if Ben meant to start Rhamondre over Aaron Rodgers but it totally worked this week!

#### 9. Great British Baker Show (preseason: 10)

Similar to Ben, there‚Äôs a mix of stuff going on here. Baker went nuclear, Dobbins looked great (albeit on the bench of Nick) as did Nico Collins. But Rome Odunze is hurt and Nick got pretty much nothing out of Javonte Williams and Evan Engram. We‚Äôll have to wait and see here - definitely enough good players where Nick could turn it around after an 0-2 start.

### TIER 5:

#### 10. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (preseason: 9)

50 point difference between my max PF and my actual PF, oops. Love to see Jayden Reed shine in the national spotlight and I always love watching deep Rashid Shaheed bombs but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs pretty much all the good stuff this week. MHJ was a non-factor, Drake London didn‚Äôt get the improved QB play we were expecting, and Puka nooooooo. We‚Äôll see what happens in week 2, but this is exactly the scenario I was afraid of that prevented me from pushing chips in and trading for some RBs. I think we‚Äôre gonna have to wait till next year..

### TIER 6:

#### 11. Wetzel Jetzel (preseason: 11)

Joe got some encouraging sights in week 1: Jameson Williams finally had a big game, Kahlil Shakir looks like he‚Äôs gonna be more involved, and Jalen McMillan has clearly won the WR3 role for the Bucs. Joe‚Äôs down to 1 QB, so it‚Äôs a race to the bottom for him, but good to see a few of his guys showing some life.

#### 12. McConkey Tonk Honky Bonk (preseason: 12)

Pretty good debut for this team‚Äôs namesake, who scored 12.40 points week 1. Devonta Smith looked solid as well, and with 2 QBs I actually may end up moving Max above Joe in future weeks, especially if Jordan Mason ends up playing more. And a pretty good week for Max‚Äôs tradechips I mean RBs!
