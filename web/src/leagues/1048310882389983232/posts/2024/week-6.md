## Author's note

New format? New format! Welcome to the new home of these weekly recaps! I should acknowledge that building this website was very much of a case of solving a non-existent problem. My system of "write everything in a google doc and then copy and paste into a text" worked great! Like totally fine, no issue at all. So why do this? Well, a few reasons:

- Most of all, I wanted a little personal project to keep some of my less-frequently-used coding skills sharp. So I went and built a blog-style site and had a ton of fun doing it!
- I do love that it gives me more formatting flexibility. I was struggling with the lack of different typography styles (headings were a nightmare). Plus now I can do links like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley), add bulletpoints, and do _itatlics_ and **bold** styling. And pretty much anything else I can think of - after all, this is a totally custom site.

I should note that this is (hopefully) not the final form of the site. A few things that I definitely want to add/change soon:

- Links to the other recaps. You can technically get to them by going to the [main page](../../) or by changing the URL, but I want more of a posts navigation thing on the side
- The styles. The gradient background is nice but it's also a default style of the component library I'm using. I want something a little more custom. If anyone has ideas lmk, but keep in mind I'm trying not to make it just the chungus brand since this site is also going to be home for content from other leagues (well, at least one).

Joe's also excited about using the sleeper API to do some stats and charts and stuff, so maybe keep an eye out for that. The main point I want to convey is this: **if you have any ideas for fun/useful features, lmk!** This is a fun project and pretty much anything is possible, so would love some ideas for things to add.

Now let's back to the usual content but in its new form!

- **Tolbert**: 2

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

Weird losing streak for Julian continues, as he loses his 3rd and 4th straight and is 1-5 over the past three weeks. There isn't a whole lot of consistency to the problem though, with this week poor performances from Dak and Saquon were the main culprits. I'm keeping Julian in the top spot because he's still 7-5 and I think his roster is still the clear best in the league. That said, he does finally have some company in this top tier...

#### 2. Steezy Nix (last week: 2)

Welcome Plank! If we're talking rosters alone, I think Julian is in a tier of his own, but we're now 6 weeks into the season and Alex is 10-2 with no signs of slowing down. He's in a great position to get a bye and therefore deserves to be put in the top tier. Justin Fields and Bo Nix have exceeded expectations at QB, and with new talk of Tua returning this year you gotta figure Alex is feeling good about QB right now. Chris Godwin is an absolute monster - doesn't even matter that he took all the balls away from Mike Evans. Kamara, Jacobs, Diontae, and Chuba all continue to eat and the vibes are certainly nice and steezy rn.

### Tier 2

#### 3. Kastration Station (last week: 4)

Every time I got close to catching up with Charlie in points this week one of his guys would get a touchdown - he had 11 total this week! I have no frame of reference for if that's actually a significant number or not but it sure seems like it! Nice to see Tank Dell finally scoring points this year. Last year's Purdy trade continues to pay dividends as Purdy is QB8 on the year and Charlie is still relatively deep at WR. A 135 point with Kyren on bye? Pretty, pretty good!

#### 4. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 3)

There was a moment there where it looked like I was going to have a perfect week with lots of early production. Thennn the injuries started to hit. Marvin joined Nabers in the headache club, Jayden Reed missed some time mid-game, and Rashid Shaheed seems like he might miss some time. I really need Nabers to stop going to Travis Scott concerts and get back on the field this week. Love to see the RBs I traded for go off - really a new experience for me getting production there. And finally shoutout to Spencer Rattler, who seems like a bit of a cocky POS but did a pretty good job throwing the football on Sunday!

#### 5. Absolute Unitas (last week: 5)

Connor could easily be in the 3 or 4 spot, these teams are all very tightly bunched. Chase Brown is getting more and more snaps every week, Josh Downs is an alpha when Joe Flacco is playing, and boy do I love watching Huge Cole do his HR touchdown celebration. I'm not sure how Con's gonna handle a Dowdle bye week but there's enough firepower on the rest of this roster where he'll probably be fine. His young QB duo continues to shine and you could argue that the value add of Flacco throwing to Downs is better for Connor than Richardson playing right now (I don't want to argue this please don't say anything about it oh god I already regret saying it).

#### 6. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 6)

![sad clams](https://i.imgflip.com/96urqc.jpg)

Yeahhhh this new format rocks I can just put memes right in the middle of posts like this. Admittedly the Clams are actually 5-7 so that one is a bit premature but just you wait...They'll be back...An exactly 1 point different in points you don't see that every day. In an ironic change of pace, the non-QBs on Cam's roster didn't pull their weight and Cam suffered a tough 0-2 week. It might be joever for Zack Moss at this point and Trey Sermon ain't doing it right now with Taylor out. Let's get Kelce back from bye and give Jakobi a bunch of targets without Davante and get back to .500, dear.

### Tier 3

#### 7. The Lamarmy (last week: 9)

Don't look now but Danny's on a bit of a roll.. D'Andre Swift is a big part of that as he's rattled off weeks of 26, 19, and 19.9 points after being declared dead in week 3. Lamar is absolutely rolling, Bijan finally had the kind of game we've been waiting for, and well well well look who it is (it's Mark Andrews). Olave being concussed and Calvin Ridley being basically a non-contributer though are big problems so let's not get too carried away here. But good couple of weeks puts Danny higher in the rankings in a tier above...

### Tier 4

#### 8. Team benstone099 (last week: 10)

I'm not sure why Ben started Tyler Conklin over George Kittle this week, but he managed to squeak out a win over Cam to stay 2 games under .500. Today was a big day in trade news in the NFL and it was especially relevant for Ben's team: Davante Adams getting traded to the Jets gives Ben a surprise stack and Amari Cooper goes from the worst QB in football to one of the best. Should be a nice boost for the benston099 boys! Also Derek Henry is so good at football.

#### 9. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 7)

I won't pretend to know what's going on in Brian's personal life. For all I know this was a tough week for him or he's in the middle of the woods somewhere. But these rankings have established (kind of) rules, and one of those is that if you don't pay attention to your lineup, you're getting knocked down the rankings. Brian started Derek Carr this week, who we've known all week long wouldn't play. We also knew a few days ago that Rachaad White wouldn't play and I'm guessing most of us would've started Bucky Irving over Jeudy or Lazard. That's an ~40 point swing for being asleep at the wheel.

‚òùÔ∏è I wrote all that before Brian snuck ahead of Joe on Monday night and ended up 1-1. That leaves him 4-8 which definitely looks a lot nicer than 3-9 but still, not great. What started as such a promising roster continues to teeter on the edge of falling out of the playoff picture completely.

### Tier 5

#### 10. Bye Baker We Miss You(last week: 8)

The tank is on and it's glorious. The former bakery boys scored a measly 62.08 points this week as Nick heads for the draft lottery. His late pickup of Sean Tucker - while undoubtedly astute - does mean that his max PF is going to be about 30 points higher than it would've been otherwise. Oh well - these are good problems to have. The bad problems to have are things like ETN's injury, Tank Bigsby's lack of production even with the ETN injury, and Kyler getting bottled up for the 2nd time in 3 games. I suspect that we'll being seeing a lot of movement between these last 3 teams in the rankings ROS.

#### 11. McConkey‚Äôs Bonked Up Boys (last week: 12)

Big week for the bonked up boys whose name I double-checked this time as they put up a nice 118.98 points. Caleb has gotten better every week, DeVonta Smith had a nice game in his return to action, and Alexander Mattison has taken control of the LV backfield. _Scrolls down to the bench_ oh hey look at that Doubs had a good game! That's nice, good trade. Also seems like Max has 3 starting QBs now, which is more than most teams in the league can say. I'd say this is enough to bump him back up to 11 ü´®ü´®ü´®

#### 12. The Danny Pretzeler ü•® (last week: 11)

Idk about the new name Joe... I feel like when you base your identity on the misfortune of others you're doomed for failure. Sure enough, Joe grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory this week in a narrow loss to mudded Brian. But there's plenty of good here: Zay Flowers has been awesome this year - what a win-win trade that was - Ty Chandler may see some action this week if Aaron Jones is still hurt, and a heck of a debut for Drake Maye! That's gotta be encouraging for Joe.
