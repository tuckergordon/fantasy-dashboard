Monday night was one of the worst sports nights I can remember for me. First off, my dear Yankees lost game 3. With Nabers only needing a single catch to put me ahead of Julian and the median, Daniel Jones did his thing and threw a pick, committing me to 0-2. As if that weren't bad enough, turns out that pick led me to lose to Ben (who had Steeler's defense) in our redraft league. All of this after I went to bed Sunday night in a great spot before CeeDee went off in the 4th quarter. Bad bad bad.

But so it goes! I won a couple games earlier this season in a similar fashion. Definitely sucks to be on the losing end especially when I really could've used a lift with the Yankees losing, but ah well. That's just fantasy I suppose. Let's get down to business.

## 🤝 Trade Review


### Danny receives:

- Garrett Wilson
- Danny's 2025 2nd
- Charlie's 2025 3rd

### Joe receives:
- Danny's 2025 1st
- Danny's 2027 1st

Let's start with Danny's side cause I think it's the more straightforward one. At _minimum_, Danny adds good depth to a roster that has struggled with injuries this season. More than that though, he adds to a strong core of young WRs that now includes Wilson, Chase, Olave, and Addison. He's got a great collection of young talent that should not only help him this year, but keep him competitive for years to come.

As for the price of GWilly, it does kinda feel like Joe is selling low here, which is surprising given how high he's been on Wilson in the past. I think the more _fun_ way to look at Joe's side is that he's making a bet that Danny's team returns to its sub-.500 ways and that 2025 1st ends up being a lottery. But I think that's probably a long shot given how Danny's team is looking. 

I was surprised to realize that despite all the negative stuff I feel like I've seen about him this year, Wilson is WR7 on the season - he's been good! I tend to trust Joe on these things and if he's selling a guy for less than I think he should, it does make me second guess a bit. But I'm going to give an **A** to Danny and a **C+** to Joe for this trade. I think that for a trade that Joe didn't have to make, I'd like to see a bigger return. 

## 🧠 Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone’s Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

Julian's damn lucky to come out of this week 11-5 instead of 9-7 but that's what happened and the strongest roster in the league is back in 2nd place. He continues to bungle start/sit decisions but we've known that's his kryptonite! Rather than talk about how good this team though, I do want to circle back on the Jordan Mason trade earlier this year. Here's part of what I said when Julian traded for Mason:

> by the time playoffs come around, CMC should be back and Mason should be irrelevant. So Julian is basically paying to raise his % chance of the bye juuuust a little bit.

Ironically, Juilan's team has actually played _worse_ since that trade and now Mason could be hurt, he could lose snaps to Guerendo, and CMC seems to be coming back soon. That last point is still an unknown so this is definitely not a final evaluation of the trade, but a questionable move is looking worse and worse each week.

Julian's team still the best though so it doesn't actually matter.

### Tier 2

#### 2. Kastration Station (last week: 2)

Big week for Charlie who put up 156.06 and is absolutely rolling right now. Kupp's return and the potential for more Tank Dell targets with Diggs out means Charlie's WR room is looking as strong as it has all season. Kyren, Sonic, and Knuckles just keep doing their thing and Charlie has a solid enough bench where he should be fine in bye weeks to come. He now gets his own tier behind Julian. 

### Tier 3

#### 3. Farkie’s Garden (last week: 3)

Tough week but the good news is that Puka Nacua is **back** and should give some new life to my lineup which has faded a bit in recent weeks. I'd certainly feel better about things if Daniel Jones weren't the one throwing to Nabers (though Maleek didn't really do DJ any favors with all his drops), but this is still a great group and a solid roster all around. I'll keep myself at 3 for another week.

#### 4. The Lamarmy (last week: 4)
