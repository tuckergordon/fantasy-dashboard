Monday night was one of the worst sports nights I can remember for me. First off, my dear Yankees lost game 3. With Nabers only needing a single catch to put me ahead of Julian and the median, Daniel Jones did his thing and threw a pick, committing me to 0-2. As if that weren't bad enough, turns out that pick led me to lose to Ben (who had Steeler's defense) in our redraft league. All of this after I went to bed Sunday night in a great spot before CeeDee went off in the 4th quarter. Bad bad bad.

But so it goes! I won a couple games earlier this season in a similar fashion. Definitely sucks to be on the losing end especially when I really could've used a lift with the Yankees losing, but ah well. That's just fantasy I suppose. Let's get down to business.

## 🤝 Trade Review


### Danny receives:

- Garrett Wilson
- Danny's 2025 2nd
- Charlie's 2025 3rd

### Joe receives:
- Danny's 2025 1st
- Danny's 2027 1st

Let's start with Danny's side cause I think it's the more straightforward one. At _minimum_, Danny adds good depth to a roster that has struggled with injuries this season. More than that though, he adds to a strong core of young WRs that now includes Wilson, Chase, Olave, and Addison. He's got a great collection of young talent that should not only help him this year, but keep him competitive for years to come.

As for the price of GWilly, it does kinda feel like Joe is selling low here, which is surprising given how high he's been on Wilson in the past. I think the more _fun_ way to look at Joe's side is that he's making a bet that Danny's team returns to its sub-.500 ways and that 2025 1st ends up being a lottery. But I think that's probably a long shot given how Danny's team is looking. 

I was surprised to realize that despite all the negative stuff I feel like I've seen about him this year, Wilson is WR7 on the season - he's been good! I tend to trust Joe on these things and if he's selling a guy for less than I think he should, it does make me second guess a bit. But I'm going to give an **A** to Danny and a **C+** to Joe for this trade. I think that for a trade that Joe didn't have to make, I'd like to see a bigger return. 

## 🧠 Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone’s Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

Julian's damn lucky to come out of this week 11-5 instead of 9-7 but that's what happened and the strongest roster in the league is back in 2nd place. He continues to bungle start/sit decisions but we've known that's his kryptonite! Rather than talk about how good this team though, I do want to circle back on the Jordan Mason trade earlier this year. Here's part of what I said when Julian traded for Mason:

> by the time playoffs come around, CMC should be back and Mason should be irrelevant. So Julian is basically paying to raise his % chance of the bye juuuust a little bit.

Ironically, Juilan's team has actually played _worse_ since that trade and now Mason could be hurt, he could lose snaps to Guerendo, and CMC seems to be coming back soon. That last point is still an unknown so this is definitely not a final evaluation of the trade, but a questionable move is looking worse and worse each week.

Julian's team still the best though so it doesn't actually matter.

### Tier 2

#### 2. Kastration Station (last week: 2)

Big week for Charlie who put up 156.06 and is absolutely rolling right now. Kupp's return and the potential for more Tank Dell targets with Diggs out means Charlie's WR room is looking as strong as it has all season. Kyren, Sonic, and Knuckles just keep doing their thing and Charlie has a solid enough bench where he should be fine in bye weeks to come. He now gets his own tier behind Julian. 

### Tier 3

#### 3. The Lamarmy (last week: 4)

Danny continues his rise and moves up another tier. While he unfairly attacked my extremely gracious, thoughtful, well-written rankings of the past, I will take the high road and continue to rank reasonably. This week, that means moving him up to the three spot. His roster is looking strong top to bottom and he has depth on the bench that he didn't have a few weeks ago. He's still only at .500 so let's not get _too_ crazy here, but he has closed the gap between the teams in front of him considerably and I don't seem him slowing down.

#### 4. Farkie’s Garden (last week: 3)

Tough week but the good news is that Puka Nacua is **back** and should give some new life to my lineup which has faded a bit in recent weeks. I'd certainly feel better about things if Daniel Jones weren't the one throwing to Nabers (though Maleek didn't really do DJ any favors with all his drops), but this is still a great group and a solid roster all around.

#### 5. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 5)

One of the big questions coming into this week was how Baker would perform without his top two WRs and the answer was a strong 24.30 point performance that helped the Clams score a big time 148.84 points. Jonathan Taylor is healthy, Travis Kelce is getting stronger, and Jameis Winston is making a bad Deshaun Watson look even worse. Cam lost Diggs for the season this week which obviously sucks, though with Flacco taking over as the Colts's starter he can probably just plug in Pittman and not miss a beat. 

### Tier 4

#### 6. Steezy Nix (last week: 7)

Sometimes fantasy does actually go the way you think it will and with Alex starting Tutu Atwell and Troy Franklin this week, things went about as you'd predict (though he did sneak the median!). As evidenced by his GC text, Alex is well aware that he needs some WR help to compete so I guess we can stay tuned there. Meanwhile, Bo Nix is having big games, Tua looked solid in his return, and Stafford looks brand new with Puka and Kupp back. There's _juuuust_ enough here that combined with the record, I think Alex makes the playoffs but I'm not sure he goes very deep. 

#### 7. Absolute Unitas (last week: 6)

Connor's tumbling a bit and drops down a tier because of it. I won't get on his case about starting Dowdle because realistically he didn't have any other options. He's done well this season so far thanks to strong QB and WR play, but the lack of RB production may finally be getting to him plus Love and BTJ may be hurt and Richardson just lost the starting job. On the plus side, Waddle, Downs, and even Elijah Moore should be better with their new QBs and Keon Coleman continues to paly well. Con could definitely still make a run, it's just not looking quite as rosy as it once did. 

### Tier 5

#### 8. Team benstone099 (last week: 8)

For as much as these rankings change week to week, these next 3 have kinda settled into their spots. Ben had a good week, bolstered by a resurgent Achane and good performances from Kittle and Rhamondre. He's lost Christian Kirk for the season though and with Amari Cooper banged up, he doesn't have much to offer in the WR department and he doesn't have the firepower at QB/RB that some of the teams above him do to make up for it. This might be the highwater mark for team benstone099.

#### 9. Kyler X(box)Y (last week: 9)

I wasn't the only one who lost a close one this week - Nick lost to joe by a measely 1.36 points and falls to 7-9. Hopefully Tyrone Tracy will be okay, because he's looked great and was getting more and more of the snaps. Xavier Legette is intruguing to watch with Diontae gone and that's kinda the perfect word to describe this roster overall: intruiging. Not necessarily good or bad, but definitely interesting to watch and see what happens!

### Tier 6

#### 10. Mike Evans’s Brother (last week: 10)

#### 11. McConkey’s Bonked Up Boys (last week: 11)

#### 12. The Danny Pretzeler 🥨 (last week: 12)
