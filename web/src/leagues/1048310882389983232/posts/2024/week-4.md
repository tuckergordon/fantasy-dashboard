## ü§ù Trade Review

### Tucker receives:

- Joe Mixon

### Charlie receives:

- Charlie‚Äôs 2025 2nd

**Written by Joe:**
From a value perspective, I think it‚Äôs a perfectly even trade. Joe Mixon, current injury notwithstanding, seems worth a 2nd, and I think is a solid contributor to a roster that needs RB points, so I think all of it checks out from the perspective of Tucker deciding to take advantage of the players on his team that _are_ scoring points and his record through 4 weeks to try and make a push. At first, I was pretty confused by Charlie moving away a win-now piece like Mixon, but when I took a closer look at his roster, it makes a lot of sense. Running back is really the only position that he had enough depth, to the point where finding a way to turn Mixon into some useful assets, in this case a pick that can be flipped if necessary, is a pretty good pivot. For Tucker, the only thing that surprises me is that it feels a little bit like a half measure, and certainly not enough of a move to move him into full contender status. All that being said, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction, so I can laud that. Overall, good trade for both teams that feels pretty win-win.

### Charlie receives:

- Khalil Shakir

### Joe receives:

- Charlie‚Äôs 2027 2nd

Charlie‚Äôs WR depth was thin this week with Tank Dell out, so rather than start Alec Pierce he went out and got a good young WR for a reasonable cost. I like this move for Charlie - Shakir is seemingly breaking out this year and is consistently getting a high target % in a powerful Bills offense. Charlie needed another WR and in general is trying to get younger, and this move accomplishes both of those things.

On Joe‚Äôs side I think this one is a little less clear but I think the case for this move basically comes down to two things: trying to sell high on Shakir and hoping that Charlie‚Äôs 2027 2nd ends up being a good one. Joe has plenty of young WRs, but Shakir is probably the only one that he could get a 2nd for and would be willing to sell for a 2nd. The fact that he traded for Charlie‚Äôs 2027 2nd and not the 2025 one I just returned to Chuck probably means that Joe thinks the 2027 one will be more valuable and that Charlie probably wanted to keep the 2025 one. I don‚Äôt actually think this impacts Joe‚Äôs Tank much, meaning I don‚Äôt think trading away Shakir will meaningfully reduce his max PF and increase his chances of ending the season in last. He‚Äôs got plenty of other similar or better WRs that his points should stay pretty similar. I think this is a fine move for Joe, though he definitely runs the risk of looking foolish if Shakir continues to improve.

## üß† Power Rankings

### TIER 1:

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

Julian flirted with an 0-2 week against Max but a strong MNF showing allowed him to go 1-1. It was certainly a down week by his standards, but one that I think is more a product of statistical randomness than anything meaningful or concerning. Definitely keeping an eye on next week when he faces a surging Alex and will have Saquon on a bye.

### TIER 2:

#### 2. Steezy Nix (last week: 4)

A week after losing a close, high-scoring matchup, Alex was on the winning side of one this week, beating Cam 145.48-141.94. Justin Fields - who is outscoring Joe Burrow so far this year btw - was a big part of that, finally getting some rushing action and scoring 31 points. There has been no bigger beneficiary of Andy Dalton in our league than Plank whose offense has been fueled by Diontae Johnson and Chuba Hubbard. The latter looks to get a bit more time before Brooks arrives and Plank is still hoping to get CMC back at some point.

#### 3. Kastration Station (last week: 3)

Another strong showing from Charlie with contributions up and down the lineup‚Ä¶ or maybe just down, Daniel Jones was at the top and he kinda sucked. Dallas Goedert is TE1 on the season, which has been quite the edge for Charlie in a dismal TE year (though Goedert will also be on bye next week). It‚Äôs wild how productive Gibbs and Montgomery continue to be but there‚Äôs no signs of them slowing down. Heck even Courtland Sutton got in on the action. Good week for Charlie.

#### 4. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 2)

Brian almost came back Monday night with strong showings from Goff and Pollard, but he came up just shy and goes 0-2 this week, falling to 3-5 on the season. It‚Äôs pretty hard to win when Josh Allen and Breece Hall combine for only 11 points! I would expect Xavier Worthy to re-enter Brian‚Äôs lineup now that Rashee Rice is hurt, but this WR room is definitely struggling right now as Tyreek and the Dolphins are just not doing it right now. Get well soon, Tua.

#### 5. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 5)

The newly-acquired Mixon ended up not being healthy enough to play, but I got enough production out of Roschon Johnson and Cordarrelle Patterson that it ended up being okay. The Harrison-Nabers-Reed-London WR group has already become elite, so much so that Puka not coming back for another month at least doesn‚Äôt even feel like a big deal right now. With that WR group, 2 good QBs, an improved RB room, and a (kind of) resurgent Dalton Kincaid, I‚Äôm feeling great about where things are at right now. Not daring to rank myself any higher than 5th though until Jonathon Brooks is healthy and actually scoring points.

### TIER 3:

#### 6. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 8)

The Clams have been tough luck losers three weeks in a row now, and are 4-4 despite being 3rd in PF. As Danny pointed out in chat, it‚Äôs not often you get double digit production from every player and lose but such is the way for the Clams right now. There are some upward trending arrows for Cam right now: I‚Äôd expect Kelce to get more action after the Rice injury, Michael Pittman got a lot more work with Joe Flacco under center (though that may not last), and Nick Chubb is finally practicing. Cam‚Äôs gotten squeezed so far no doubt, but he has a pretty soft matchup against Max next week that should help him start getting more wins in the bank.

#### 7. Absolute Unitas (last week: 6)

Really tough injury week for Connor, who lost both Rashee Rice and Anthony Richardson. Richardson luckily seems to have evaded a more serious injury and Con was probably going to bench him for Jordan Love anyways. The Rice injury though is brutal and leaves Connor lacking for WR depth. JJeff + BTJ + Waddle is still a good squad, except now instead of Rice it‚Äôs probably going to be Josh Downs (hey he had a great week but also a lot of that might‚Äôve been because Flacco was throwing it to him). But Connor only drops one spot because his RBs caught fire, Daniels/Love are going sicko mode right now, and I had to drop Ben a spot (more on that in a second).

#### 8. Team benstone099 (last week: 7)

Pretty good week for Ben but he wasn‚Äôt paying attention and started Trey McBride (out), so he automatically gets knocked down a ranking. Manager attentiveness has to be considered in the rankings equation sorry Ben! Would‚Äôve had the median if he‚Äôd started Kittle. Aside from that though, sheesh what a week for Derrick Henry. Dude is absolutely feasting as a Raven. This Dolphins stuff though sucks, we miss you De‚ÄôVon!

### TIER 4:

#### 9. The Lamarmy (last week: 9)

It‚Äôs looking more and more like this isn‚Äôt going to be a playoff year for Danny. Despite a high-scoring return from Jordan Addison and continued strong play from Lamar and Ja‚ÄôMarr, Danny failed to hit the century mark this week and falls to a dismal 1-7. D‚ÄôAndre Swift actually put together a great game, but he unfortunately did so on the bench while Carson Steele scored -0.90 points. Mark Andrews is a huge problem for Danny, he‚Äôs basically unstartable at this point. The QB room is a mess after Lamar too, as Minshew seems like he‚Äôs about to be benched and Herbert is hurt, underperforming, or both. I think for Danny to come back this year he‚Äôs going to need three things: Herbert playing like at least a QB2, Mark Andrews returning to form, and D‚ÄôAndre Swift continuing to score points. Especially with the injury to Pacheco, Danny‚Äôs going to have a hard time climbing out of this hole if he doesn‚Äôt get all 3 of those things.

#### 10. Great British Baker Show (last week: 9)

Nico Collins is so sick, man. The WR1 on the season put up his best performance to date and it really feels like he‚Äôs a foot taller than everyone trying to guard him. It was a surprising down week for Kyler despite playing against easiest pass defense in football, but Nick still had a fine week thanks to Baker Mayfield (QB3 on the season). I‚Äôll also admit that George Pickens has looked great this season and my harsh trade review may end up looking premature. The rest of this team is pretty shaky though: ETN is maybe hurt (?), Odunze ceded the targets he had last week, and Isaiah Likely is caught in the Baltimore receiver vortex (granted he‚Äôs getting a lot more action than Andrews rn). Nick may move up a few spots at some point but I think I‚Äôm gonna leave him here for now.

### TIER 5:

#### 11. McConkey Tonk Honky Bonk (last week: 11)

Dang, so close Max we were all rooting for ya. Max has of course been the other big beneficiary of Andy Dalton‚Äôs success as it‚Äôs given him a second starting QB. He might get a third here soon if AOC takes over for Minshew. Jordan Mason continues to be an RB1 in CMC‚Äôs spot and it was great to see a strong game from this team‚Äôs namesake, Ladd McConkey. This team is looking a heck of a lot better than it did at the start of the season, even with Caleb‚Äôs struggles.

#### 12.5. Wetzel Jetzel (last week: 12)

Remember that ‚Äúmanager not paying attention rule‚Äù that cost Ben a spot? Well nobody is above the law and Joe gets dinged for not bothering to pick up a player after trading Shakir away. Wouldn‚Äôt have impacted anything so I‚Äôm only marking him down a half a spot - these things are very complex. Anyways congrats on being the first 12.5th ranked team in Chungus Joe! Joe‚Äôs probably not getting back up to the 11 spot this season: Shakir is gone, Maye is still on the bench and doesn‚Äôt seem to be leaving any time soon, and Kyle Pitts is competing with Mark Andrews for most disappointing TE this season. Some good news this week is that Dontayvion Wicks had a big game and that could continue especially with Watson going on IR. I am admittedly very intrigued at the Danny/Joe matchup next week which happens to fall on Justin Herbert‚Äôs bye week. Intrigue!
