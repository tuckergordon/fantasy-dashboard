Not much to say about Monday‚Äôs late night action, Danny really nailed it. I was indeed peacefully
asleep and woke up to just wonderful news. I try to enjoy weeks like that because I also know all
too well what it feels like to be on the other side, wanting to rip your hair out.

Biiiiggg rankings shakeup this week. A lot of that is because of all the injuries across the league
but it‚Äôs also that things have shifted now that the season has begun and also I‚Äôm a wishy washy
spineless sentient flip flop changing my mind depending on where the tides take me. Enjoy!

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

AJ Brown and Deebo getting hurt not great, especially when Ken Walker and Raheem Mostert are hurt as
well. But will Julian even miss a beat here? He‚Äôll simply plug in Brandon Aiyuk, DK Metcalf, James
Cook, and Rachaad White and continue to outscore everyone else in this league by double digits. Oh
and Brock Bowers is dynasty TE1 now.

### TIER 2:

#### 2. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 2)

Bad week for Brian but also it‚Äôs hard not to when Josh Allen, Jared Goff, and Tyreek Hill all
undershoot their projections by 10 points. Not only will those players score more going forward, but
now Derek Carr is popping off 22 point weeks and Braelon Allen is getting serious touches. Brian
needs Njoku back or Jordan Love to return and make Tucker Kraft usable again, but this team is full
of star power and plenty of bench support and guys with upside. For the second week in a row, Brian
is alone in tier 2.

### TIER 3:

#### 3. The Lamarmy (last week: 3)

Danny sits at 1-3 after week 2‚Äôs brutal loss, but that‚Äôs not a big hole to climb out of‚Ä¶ yet. The
Pacheco injury is a big one, not just because he was great but because it means more playing time
for D‚ÄôAndre Swift (who‚Äôs been bad) and whoever Danny decides to put in his flex spot (currently
Jordan Addison). Danny still leads his tier because guys like Bijan, Olave, and Ridley have all
looked great and honestly the teams behind him have plenty of holes themselves. This is a risky team
but it‚Äôs still a good team and it leads this tier.

#### 4. Team benstone099 (last week: 8)

After a disappointing week one Ben‚Äôs boys..who am I kidding they‚Äôre men, too old to be boys.. mashed
in week 2. Drafting Achane 1.12 might‚Äôve single-handedly given Ben another couple years of
contending - he‚Äôs legitimately one of the best RBs in football rn. Good weeks from Adams, Henry,
Kittle, and Rhamondre led to a 129 point for the stone099s in a key matchup against Brian. Arrow
pointing back up!

#### 5. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 6)

Cam‚Äôs team looks fine, maybe even good. Not great but good. Just a good solid team. He really,
really needs Kelce to start scoring points though otherwise his ceiling is capped and he‚Äôs going to
have more losses like week 2‚Äôs 121-106 loss to Nick. The lack of Pittman production with Richardson
is concerning, but otherwise Cam‚Äôs starters look good and he should be fine. Again, not great! But
fine.

### TIER 4:

#### 6. Kastration Station (last week: 4)

The Kastrating might be starting‚Ä¶ of course right after I talk up Kupp week 1 and how much he could
mean to Charlie‚Äôs team, he goes on IR. Abysmal showing by Charlie this week losing to a roster
starting Greg Dortch and Jalen Nailor. Joe Mixon is banged up too now and Jayden Daniels seems
scared to throw it to Terry when he‚Äôs further than 7 yards down field. At least Kirk Cousins looked
great on the last drive, cause he looked extremely washed the rest of the game. Hopefully that‚Äôs a
sign of good things to come, otherwise this team (and the falcons) could be in trouble.

#### 7. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 10))

Well hey there folks look at me go! After declaring Tank, the boys really rebounded last week and
finally this roster is looking like what I was hoping it would. MHJ and Nabers look like legit studs
already and that final touchdown made London‚Äôs line a lot better looking. Still waiting for Dalton
Kincaid to show up and Bryce getting benched ain‚Äôt great for my future QB prospects, but the Pacheco
injury means Perine might now be an actual legit starting option. Here we come.

#### 8. Absolute Unitas (last week: 7)

Funny how the team that declares tanking goes 2-0 and the team that says they want to compete goes
0-2. Richardson and Daniels can‚Äôt collectively score 50 points every week, so this will happen. It
seems like Jefferson is fine, so Connor avoided that scare. The Waddle production was already
concerning, especially with Tua out, but Rashee Rice looks fantastic and Brian Thomas Jr has shown
big play ability. If either Dowdle or Brown takes over their backfield more, this team will be good.

#### 9. Great British Baker Show (last week: 9)

Great week for Nick who goes 2-0 and is back to .500. Kyler and Baker might be the most fun QB duo
in the league right now, Dobbins and Nico are absolutely balling, and is that‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ is that
QJ actually looking like a real NFL receiver? Ooookkayyyy.

This is the hardest team to read. I could easily see them making another run like last year, fueled
by heart and tenacity. If one of Watson/Polk/Odunze/QJ can be a weekly starter this year, nick‚Äôs got
a pretty strong roster going.

#### 10. Steezy Nix (last week: 5)

Plank gets a win against Joe but is tumbling right now. The win was really thanks to a classic
Kamara 40 point gem, and he, Jacobs, and Godwin are really holding the team on their back‚Äôs right
now. The Tua injury is obviously devastating and sad. Luckily Justin Fields continues to start, but
Stafford has nobody to throw to and Nix looks like a rookie QB. Hopefully better days to come for
Diontae Johnson once Dalton starts throwing to him and Jake Ferguson should return so that Alex
doesn‚Äôt need to play JaTavion Sanders. But this lineup is still gonna have Brandon cooks or Darnell
Mooney in it and.. that‚Äôs probably not what you want. Get well soon, Christian and Tua.

### TIER 5:

#### 11. Wetzel Jetzel (last week: 11)

Lots of great trends from Joe‚Äôs team to start the season. Honestly thought about bumping him up a
tier, but I think that has to wait until he has a 2nd starting QB. JSN finally is looking like the
guy Joe thought he was getting when he drafted him 1.05, Zay Flowers continues to be Lamar‚Äôs top
target, Jameson Williams seems to be breaking out, and Khalil Shakir might be the best receiver on
the Bills. Now if we can just figure out what‚Äôs going on GWilly and Kyle Pitts..

#### 12. McConkey Tonk Honky Bonk (last week: 12)

A win! Oooh baby a win! Similar to Joe, there‚Äôs actually a lot of good signs coming from our 12th
ranked team. Jordan Mason and Devin Singletary are both looking great in their roles and Devonta
Smith is thriving in AJ Brown‚Äôs absence. The bad news? The bears can‚Äôt protect Caleb, Sam LaPorta
isn‚Äôt getting passes, and did I mention this team is starting Nailor and Dortch? Still, this is a
much better looking team than I thought it would be early on.
