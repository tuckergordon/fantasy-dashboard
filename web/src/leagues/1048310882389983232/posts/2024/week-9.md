I'm so tired of losing. In the past 2 weeks, the following has happened:

- The election and all the bad bad things that happened in it (big gap)
- The Yankees lost the World Series
- My 3 fantasy teams went a combined 0-8, including multiple MNF final drive losses

I'm sick of it. Sick of it I tell ya! The first two aren't going to change any time soon, so I'm
looking for my garden boys to right the ship real soon. I decided to take matters into my own hands
a bit and make a couple trades! More on those in a bit..

## ü•£ Tudbert Bowl

Oh baby we got action, the Tudbert bowl is more alive than ever!! Not only did Jalen Tolbert score
another touchdown, but Khalil Herbert was traded to the Bengals. Will he finally get some snaps and
even a tud or two? Would love to see this thing get competitive. Good for viewership, you know?

- **Herbert**: 1
- **Tolbert**: 3

## ü§ù Trade Review

### Tucker receives:

- Blake Corum
- Ben's 2027 4th

### Ben receives:

- Jalen Tolbert
- Andrei Iosivas

_Written by Charlie_

This trade is a bit odd, but it really illustrates the current status of both Tucker and Ben‚Äôs
teams. For Ben, it emphasizes his utter desperation at receiver. Prior to this trade he only had TWO
active receivers he could even slot in: Davante Adams and Malachi Corley (the bozo on the Jets who
dropped a touchdown and will likely never feel the ball in his hand ever again). Everyone else is
either inactive or injured, either with shorter term injuries or who are returning soon (Amari, DJ
Chark, Gabe Davis) or who are on IR and done for the season (Christian Kirk), and Jauan Jennings was
on bye (who was also injured prior to SF‚Äôs bye‚Ä¶). So in order to field a complete roster at all, Ben
chose to give up his valuable 2nd round pick this past year in Blake Corum for two‚Ä¶ how shall we
say‚Ä¶ ‚Äúdepth‚Äù receivers. In Corum, Ben loses potentially massive value in future seasons at the RB
position and a high value handcuff this year behind Kyren Williams. He gains Tolbert (Tudbert) and
Iosivas, who, fortunately for Ben both scored TD‚Äôs this week and helped propel him to being the
highest scoring team in Week 9. Granted, Tolbert caught a garbage time TD from Cooper Rush after
Ceedee left the game with a minor injury and Iosivas caught only one of his four targets for a 10
yard TD reception in the second consecutive game that Tee Higgins missed with a lingering quad
injury. It feels like, given the truly minor involvement for both of these players, that they will
not provide Ben with much more than around 0-15 points per week. If Ben can continue to be lifted by
his RBs, QBs, and T McBs, maybe this will be just fine. But I can‚Äôt help but wonder if Ben gave up
major future value for a pretty meager band-aid for his present woes.

For Tucker, this trade is far simpler. He had some expendable receivers to trade, a position for
which he has a considerable abundance of talent. With Corum, Tucker now has a potential future
replacement for Mixon or Dobbins, as well as some insurance depth once he is able to start getting
playing time, although when exactly that might be or what the dynamic will be with Kyren next year
is quite obscure. But, not even 8 years ago, Derrick Henry did not play much at all behind Demarco
Murray, and then blossomed into the perennial King he is now. In my eyes, this is a major win for
Tucker for an indisputable bargain price in two risky flex-type receivers, and he even gets back
what is fixing to be a high pick in Ben‚Äôs 2027 4th rounder, when most of his current roster will be
applying for Medicare.

### Tucker receives:

- Breece Hall
- Brian's 2025 3rd

### Brian receives:

- Tucker's 2025 1st
- Danny's 2026 1st

## üß† Power Rankings

### Tier 1

#### 1. Bone‚Äôs Friggin Bonies (last week: 1)

After much consternation over whether or not to trade for a WR this week, Julian ended up picking up
Pray-Pray McTouchdown and that went exactly as he hoped it would! Unfortunately, he also lost Dak to
IR, which obviously hurts him at QB but also could impact CeeDee's output (I doubt it though, he's
too good). Julian's hoping AJ Brown isn't too banged up cause the last thing he needs is another WR
injury. TJ Hockenson returned giving Julian an extremely good TE room. The Dak injury sucks but
he'll plug that hole with Geno, Russ, and Darnold and will be fine. Number 1 team.

### Tier 2

#### 2. Kastration Station (last week: 2)

Charlie pushes his win streak up to 8-0 with another strong showing. I just audibly said "wait what"
while looking down his roster and realizing that Daniel Jones was his number 1 scoring player last
week. Cooper Kupp has looked great in his return from injury and Tank Dell is gobbling up targets
and even though Nico is (hopefully) back this week, we saw last year how many points these two can
score when they're both slotted in there. Charlie's got a 2 game lead over Julian at the moment, and
while I don't really expect him to hold that rest of season, I think his chances of getting the
other bye are pretty high.

#### 3. Farkie‚Äôs Garden (last week: 4)

I was going to move Danny up to the 3 spot but the Breece trade changes things. Breece feels like
the final piece of the puzzle for this team. Mixon and Dobbins are great, but adding Breece to the
roster gives me a true RB1 for (hopefully) years to come and allows me more flexibility with my flex
spot. With Jonathon Brooks making his debut this week, my RB room is looking stronger than ever and
I'm back to feeling good about my team despite the recent tumble.

#### 4. The Lamarmy (last week: 3)

While Danny's roster is mighty impressive and has been on quite the roll, he did just lose Olave to
a pretty gnarly looking hit and concussion. Danny's recent Garrett Wilson trade certainly makes that
easier to bear though, and he has enough other depth now where he should be able to sustain it.
Herbert has looked great these past two weeks and I don't need to tell you how good Lamar continues
to be. Should be a fun race between these 10-8 teams the rest of the way!

### Tier 3

#### 5. Absolute Unitas (last week: 7)

With Zack Moss out for the year and Zeke's mysterious absence, Connor saw big performances from
Chase Brown and Rico Dowdle this week leading him to a strong 131.76 points. If those two keep this
up, Connor's got a pretty good looking team here especially with Cade Otton turning into a target
magnet in Tampa. Connor does has 3 pretty volatile players in BTJ, Waddle, and Downs, so his week to
week performances may vary. He's 12-6 though and with the talent he has in his starting lineup, he's
going to be a strong contender down the stretch.

#### 6. Team Crams_Clams (last week: 5)

The clams took me down this week thanks to the Chiefs's inability to get a 1st down and Baker
Mayfield being an absolute savage in the pocket. That swing means that there are 3 of us tied at
10-8. I know Cam's gotta be excited to see Kelce racking up points like he used to, though the
Michael Pittman situation is pretty concerning and I'm not quite sure Cam has any other choice right
now other than to keep running him out there. Nick Chubb and Jonathan Taylor are the two big
wildcards here - if either or both of them can get back to their RB1 days, the clams will ascend.
For now, they stay in tier 3.

#### 7. Steezy Nix (last week: 6)

I know I've been complaining a lot recently but Alex has had it bad for a while now. He too lost
late Monday night and falls to 12-6. Despite losing his top 2 WRs and having Diontae seemingly
banished to the shadow realm on the Ravens (for now), Alex still has a great record and seems to be
getting CMC back this week. That could obviously be a big boost, though it's not like he hasn't been
getting good RB production. WR is clearly still the issue, even though Darnell Mooney is somehow the
WR12 (!!) on the season. Besides that big hole, things are looking pretty solid for the Steezies.

#### 8. Team benstone099 (last week: 8)

Last week I had the most tiers ever but I've really condensed this week. This tier is all over the
place. Ben's at the bottom of it but he just scored 165 points so what do I know. With Tua back, the
RB duo of Achane and King Henry (no typos for me on that one today) is lethal, and Rhamondre's no
slouch himself. Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes turned back the clock a bit and scored 45 points
between them, and well well well, would you look at that: touchdowns for Tolbert and Iosivas. Thanks
for the trade review chuck but I'm sorry to say that you have no idea what you're talking about ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
In all seriousness, Ben really needs Amari Cooper to get healthy otherwise his ceiling is going to
be limited (though Juaun Jennings helps). That's why he stays 8th despite a really awesome week that
had me really thinking about moving him up.

### Tier 4

#### 9. Kyler X(box)Y (last week: 9)

Man when Kyler is bad it's ugly. Stupid COD... the tank continues for Nick who drops to 7-11 but
continues to have encouraging signs from his young players. Tyrone Tracy looked good
post-concussion, Rome Odunze saw more targets, Xavier Legette scored a touchdown, and Cedric Tillman
might end up being the best FA move in our league this season. With Nico coming back next week and
positive regression coming for Kyler, I'd expect Nick to get some more wins before season's end.

#### 10. Mike Evans‚Äôs Brother (last week: 10)

Seems Brian is committing to the tank, which is probably the right move now that he's 4-14. Even
with Breece gone, he's got a solid roster so, like Nick, I wouldn't expect him to just roll over
like the bottom two teams. Between Josh Allen, Jared Goof, Tyreek Hill, Aaron Jones, Tony Pollard,
and DJ Moore (just to name a few - there are plenty more good players on this roster), Brian's got
talent and I'd guess the wins return, just not enough to get him back into the playoff picture.

### Tier 7

#### 11. The Danny Pretzeler ü•® (last week: 11)

Maybe I gotta start writing these things from the bottom up. I swear whenever I get here it becomes
such a grind. Do I _really_ need to write about Joe starting D'Ernest Johnson (2 caries), Ty
Chandler (0 snaps), and Jalen McMillan (inactive)? I can't even enjoy JSN's insane game because it
led to Joe beating me in our other league. JSN seems like a great young player, but now I hate him
forever sorry Mr. SN. Drake Maye is good. Okay done.

#### 12. McConkey‚Äôs Bonked Up Boys (last week: 11)

Annnd we get to Max's team. With Caleb struggling these past two weeks and Sam LaPorta going back to
irrelevance, there wasn't a whole lot of points scored by the BUBs. If Devonta Smith is hurt, the
point totals are going to be something to behold. I was curious to see if Singletary would get
traded, but instead he seems to have been relegated to RB2 duties behind Tracy. That combined with
Mattison's snaps also dropping means there really isn't much RB production on this roster these
days. Ladd is great though, we love Ladd.
